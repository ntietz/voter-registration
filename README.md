Some analysis of voter registration records


Data Sources
============

**Voter registration records**: obtainable from the Secretary of State's website. Here is the page that links to two zip files containing the whole dump, updated weekly: http://www2.sos.state.oh.us/pls/voter/f?p=111:1:0::NO:RP:P1_TYPE:STATE

That page also contains documentation on the contents of the file.

To get county numbers, find them on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Ohio#County_coding).
